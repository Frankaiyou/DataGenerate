### Data Generate
There are four main files in it;
- `1.exe`: main program;
- `data.cpp`: the Builder of a alone data;
- `Std.cpp`: the program to convert InputFiles to OutputFiles;
- `settings.txt`: the Configuration of the program.

You should generate you Datas by
1. Modify the `settings.txt`;
2. Code the `data.cpp` or `Std.cpp`;
3. Run the `1.exe`.

I use c++, you also can use other Programming language to do it, such as Python and C#;
